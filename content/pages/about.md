I am curious. For many years I was a cook. Cooking isn't a bad trade for someone who is curious. The lifestyle and the philosophy of cooking resonated with me. For a long time, I thought I'd always be a cook.

But at some point I moved into management. Cooking gave way to scheduling and ordering, designing and implementing systems, the organizational part of running a restaurant. And that's how I became curious about software.

Software in a kitchen is awkward. Cooks don't want it there. Cooks, and restaurant people in general, are passionate about sensory experience, and that is an element mostly lacking in software. Software can save time, and improve organization, so restaurants don't have much choice but to use it of course. But more often than not, systems are cobbled together. One application handles orders, another handles time cards, another handles scheduling, maybe you store some recipes on google docs, and you monitor food costs with Excel, pick one of at least 15 different POS systems (which are all complained about incessantly by waitstaff), and none of these platforms talk to each other with any efficiency.

So I got curious about restaurant software, and along the way I became curious about software in general. I played a little with Wordpress and realized I couldn't really get the control I needed. Next I tried Rails, with similar results. I started working with IOS and quickly found that I needed an understanding of web technology to get where I wanted to go with mobile, so back to Rails with a deeper look into Ruby. This all over the course of a year or two.

And then I started thinking about recipes. In my experience in professional kitchens, recipes were nearly always stored in small, leather-bound notebooks. For more formal purposes, they are sometimes typed out and stored in three-ring binders. To this day, I have not met a professional cook who stores their recipes using a mobile app.

I've spent a lot of time trying to understand why that is. Partly I think it's the experience of writing in a notebook that resonates with cooks. But if you download a few recipe apps, you might pick up on something a little deeper. See, recipe apps are not designed for people who know how to cook. Developers have found that app users will swipe through food porn a lot more voraciously than they will select and follow a recipe. So recipe apps are designed not for recipe storage, but for content delivery.

And that's where I'm at now, and I've been stuck here for several years. I had the good fortune of landing a job with one of the top recipe apps in the world just as it was being acquired by the most successful recipe website in the world. Couldn't really ask for a better introduction to the subject. I treated my new job as I would a kitchen, following along and picking up where I could see myself being valuable. Eventually I was getting my fingerprints on just about every stage of the development process from concept and design to planning and implementation, social media and community development, organizing and generating content, and anything else I could get my hands on. Along the way I tried my best to get my point of view understood.

I pushed for a new type of recipe, and a new type of recipe app, something much simpler and more intuitive, something that shifted all focus towards accessing and using a recipe. Ultimately, I found that using a recipe app as a media delivery system is just more economically attractive than building something that helps people cook.

So, I started building my own recipe app.
