Last year I found a recipe I really liked for making pizza at home. I made pizza professionally for years, but I used a wood-fired oven, and that really set the bar in a way that made it difficult for me to consider making pizza at home. Nothing really compared.

But I've relaxed my pizza expectations a little over the years and I've started to accept other styles of pizza into my life. It so happens that I was able to find a deep dish recipe that was acceptable and relatively easy to make in a standard home oven.

But now I've moved to Denver, and that throws off my whole game. The air is thinner and dryer here, leavening goes faster, cooking times are thrown off, it's kinda a mess.

On my first shot, I went for 2 different, but similar doughs. I tried an untested Detroit-style recipe along with my standard Chicago-style recipe.

The Detroit recipe worked great. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I used colder water to start, the proofing time was still low (around an hour) and the baking time was extended.

The Deep Dish didn't turn out as great, but I let it cook too long. I had cooked the Detroit dough earlier, so I assumed that cooking time would be extended for the Chicago dough. But when I checked it at the lowest stated bake time, it was already overdone. I think the dough needed to proof a little bit longer and the oven temperature should be dropped a little further.
