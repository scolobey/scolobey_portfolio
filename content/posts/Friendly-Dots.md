Having built out the MVP for Funky Radish, I'm a little stuck. My goal was to build a recipe app that I could use myself. I've released on web, Android and IOS, and I do use the app. And I don't use it just because I built it, I use the app because it's helpful to me. I consider that a major accomplishment.

But now I've got new problems to solve. Mainly, nobody else is using it.

So, like, why? First off, exposure has been minimal. I've had a few thousand impressions across all 3 platforms, but I've gotten no downloads and almost no engagement.

It points straight to the app pages.

Here's the Play Store page.

Obviously this leaves a lot to be desired.
