description: "What happens when you design a recipe app for real cooks?"
---

As a former chef with now about 5 years working to build and design recipe apps, I have a complaint. Every recipe app I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot of them, has been designed with the clear intention of making people click.

It makes sense. Engagement in the digital recipe world is fueled by imagery. Some users do place more importance on the quality of the recipe itself than on the media content it comes with. But the signal those users send is often drowned out by that of the users who just wanna get their food porn fix and be on their merry way.

Funky Radish is a recipe app for real cooks. It is designed not as a media delivery system, but as a culinary tool. The goal is to remove any distraction from the act of cooking itself. It allows you to find recipes and store them in a save and accessible place indefinitely. Where other recipe apps are mostly attempts at recreating the success of the food network in a digital format, Funky Radish only seeks to replace the tattered and stained recipe notebook in your kitchen junk drawer with something that is clean and always available.
