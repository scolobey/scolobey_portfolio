Whatever you wanna call this, it's probably the single most popular element in web design right now. Triangles with colors. It's everywhere.

Having recently moved to Denver, CO. and also recently become increasingly interested in art and design, I find myself acutely aware of a Denver-specific aesthetic. Nature is a prominent theme. Mountains and sunsets in particular. Graffiti is huge here. But there's a thread of digital design that runs through, as it seems to be doing worldwide at the moment.

I often build around an image that I'm interested in. We were in Petaluma, CA for a wedding and there was a graphic hanging in our Airbnb. Something about this image suggested Colorado, and I thought the simple geometry of it might lend itself to digital interpretation.
