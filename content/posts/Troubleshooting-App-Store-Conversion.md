description: "My app is getting impressions, but nobody is downloading. It's time to find out why."

I've built and released 2 mobile apps and a web interface. So far, none of them are getting any real traffic. But, according to App Store connect analytics, my IOS app is getting impressions. So, as far as I can tell, my app is appearing in search results, but people are mostly scrolling right by it, and if they do happen to click in to see what it's all about, they don't download. So what's the deal?

If that graph is to be trusted, over 1,000 people have encountered a listing for my app in App Store search results in the past month. And yet, only one of those people download, and I would assume that one person was me. That's pretty bad.

My first thought here is that my listing sucks. It makes sense, I really haven't put much time into it. But can it really be that bad? I mean, check out my listing versus the listing for one of the top recipe apps on the app store.

Clearly Yummly and Tasty offer more attractive search listings. But I would think at least one in a thousand people might think to give me a chance. So I'm leaning towards thinking the source of the problem may lie elsewhere.

You know, it actually doesn't make much sense that I'm even getting that many impressions to begin with. I just released my app into a crowded market. I imagine it's way down at the bottom of just about any search result. So then how are all of these people finding it?

Initially I thought I might be part of some type of program that Apple runs for new apps. I don't know why I thought that. It seems reasonable that Apple would provide you with a little traffic somehow to get you started. But I guess they're not that nice. More likely, because my app has a weird name, I've inadvertently wound up ranking on some search results where I don't belong. Yes, I've got a sneaking suspicion that the problem here isn't the listing so much as a discrepancy between product and search intent.

This is a pickle. The App Store likes to hold their cards tight. They don't just go and tell you what search results you appear under because that might give you some clues about things they don't want you to know about. Luckily, I managed to find this tool.

[SearchMan](https://searchman.com/)

I popped my apps name in there and sure enough, my app popped up and it shows me ranking for a bunch of garbage. No wonder nobody wants my milkshake.

I don't have a ton of experience with App Store Optimization (a.k.a. ASO) but I do have some experience with Search Engine Optimization (a.k.a SEO) and I know it all begins with another flippin' spreadsheet. I need to make a list of keywords and phrases I want to rank for so I can try to get some of those to show up on SearchMan.

Your first step in gathering keywords is your friendly neighborhood autocomplete. Normally, autocomplete is good for nothing but confusing your friends. But today it comes in really handy. Let's pop opened the app store and try searching for some phrases we wish we were ranking for. I have a recipe app so it makes sense that I would want to rank for the term 'recipe'.

There you have it. The app store just spit out a list of words I should have in my description. Thanks a lot Apple. I know my app isn't a nutrition calculator, but the other keywords will do just fine, particularly those first three. I repeated this technique with some other words I'd like to rank for: cooking, kitchen, culinary. I then fooled around with a thesaurus a little to see if I could take any of the words I've found and expand or replace them. My keyword list is starting to grow.

Doing a little more research on ASO I found another great tool.

Take a look at AppTweak and their keyword suggester.

I plugged in all of the words and phrases I got from autocomplete and this tool spit out a whole bunch of other phrases I can target. It also helped me uncover some apps that are similar to mine that I've never heard of. I know my idea isn't unique, but it's cool to see that most of the alternatives are pretty ugly and clunky, and some are actually expensive.

Also, don't forget to really think this through. Make sure you walk yourself through your user's perspective and try to figure out what they might type into that search bar if they were looking for your app.

So I'm up to about 40 keywords now. The next step is to try and figure out which ones to focus on. There are tools for this, but you can get pretty far by just checking the results on the App Store. If I search 'recipe box' for instance, I can see that competition is still pretty stiff. Most of my top competitors appear here, even though the list turns to irrelevant results pretty quick. But if I search 'recipe index', it really looks like I have a chance here. Search volume might be limited, but the competition is weak.

I'll target 'recipe index'. But in order to make adjustments to my app store listing, I'll need to launch a new version, and I don't have much to push right now, so I might as well get back to what I really want to work on, which is improving my app.
