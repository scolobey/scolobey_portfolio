The first in my series of UX book reviews. When I'm interested in something, I read about it. Lately I'm interested in UX, so I'll power through some UX books.

#The First Half
I'm reading from my Kindle. So I don't see pages, I only see percentage. Which is an interesting UX concept on it's own... I digress.

Alex Cooper got me to read his book and he spent the first 50% of the book bitching about developers.

That is not an exaggeration. At 10% I was already wondering when I would learn something. Little did I know I was in for another 40% of complaints and unflattering analogies.

But I'll give him this. He's totally right. Developers are selfish assholes. Programming is a dry, mathematical, and mostly academic pursuit. It doesn't invite or promote human interaction.

I'm painfully aware of that. I came to this industry from kitchens. Kitchens are decadent. Kitchens are hedonistic. Kitchens place great value on real human interaction. If you think about it, a chef is just a different kinda UX engineer.

So I roll in with a strong sense of empathy and passion for making people happy, and people with degrees and decades of experience over me are ignoring everything I say and framing me as an uninformed moron.

So yeah, maybe this book isn't for me. Maybe it's for people who don't already know  that software engineers are the single most destructive force in software development.

But I'm feeling more like a developer everyday and half way through this book, Mr. Cooper isn't offering any solutions.
