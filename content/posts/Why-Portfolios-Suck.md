I started building this because I realized that I have a bunch of weird interests and projects that I would like people to know about. I thought it might be a resume, but without the restrictive boredom of being a resume.

It may be interesting to note that I only just learned that your resume can be fancy. I was under the impression that a resume was supposed to be boring, black and white, and dry as hell with an extremely neutral typography. But I saw this girl on reddit and her resume was beige and there were some doodles on it, and it looked kinda cool in a way.

But anyway, in pursuit of this digital resume idea, I really got swept up. It's not easy to build good software. It challenges you to think in a weird way. So if I'm going to the effort of building software, it might as well be good.

So then I start thinking about my audience a little.

If my goal is finding a job building software, I'm supposed to appeal either to other people building software who can afford some help, or to people who are responsible for finding people to help those people. One pool there is probably larger than the other, but it's not as interesting really is it?

At any rate, I would want to show this audience some of the stuff I like to do, as well as some of the stuff I'm good at. I can write a little. At least without making a whole ton of mistakes. I can build websites and apps. I make some cool doodles. I know what looks okay on the internet, even though I don't usually have time to build it. But I am actually pretty good at building stuff.

I mean, most people do one thing. They either design or they write or they code or they sell or whatever. But I did my one thing. I cooked. I still cook today. The craft of building software, it's cool and interesting, but it will never be as important to my life as cooking. I would even go so far as to argue that it will never be as noble and beautiful as cooking, but that's a different discussion.
