For years, I've been hearing about this poolish thing. I know it's a baking term referencing a natural leavening process. I'm sure I've consumed plenty of products which are based on a poolish. I get the basic idea. But it's time to buckle down and go deep on this. What is a poolish?

The term 'poolish' references a specific mixture of flour, water and yeast, usually 50/50 water and flour, with yeast adjusted to hit a desired proofing time at the current temperature.

Dough develops certain desirable characteristics when fermented. It becomes more extensible and easier to handle and the resulting bread tastes better and lasts longer.

THE SCHEDULE
Poolish up to 8 hours in advance – 0.23% – 0.33%
Poolish up to 12 hours in advance – 0.1% – 0.2%
Poolish up to 16 hours in advance – 0.03% – 0.08%

amount of instant yeast needed:
amount-of-instant-yeast = amount-of-flour / 100 x percentage-of-table

To illustrate, you gotta take a look at a recipe.

A typical poolish-based pizza dough.

Combine:
100g flour
100g water
Yeast

# But how much yeast do you need?

This depends mostly on 2 factors, ambient temperature, and desired proofing time. In most cases, proofing time is probably going to fall to between 8 and 16 hours. This table serves as a rough guideline for how much instant yeast your poolish might need.

| Proofing Time  - | Yeast by percent |
|----|:---:|
| 8 hours | 3% |
| 12 hours | 2% |
| 16 hours | 1% |

So, if we're after a 12 hour poolish, with 100g flour, you should need about 2% yeast, or ...

**2 grams**

But yeast is a biological entity. There are bunch of factors that can influence how that colony growsA colony of yeast will grow faster as temperature increases to a limit (around 80F) and then it tapers off quickly until, at a high enough temperature, it dies off. So if you're making a poolish on a 60F day, versus a 70F day, it will take longer, or you will need to start with more yeast.

While the table works for a quick glance, the truth is something a little more like this:

It took me a bit to find that image and I think it's pretty cool. [I found it here. Check it out.](https://gardenandeats.wordpress.com/2014/06/25/tartine-bread-the-elusive-float-test/)

This diagram details a preferment with a hydration percentage that probably could not be classified as a poolish. But the concept is there. You can see clearly that as the temperature ingcreases, proofing time decreases.

This is an important concept that spans all naturally leavened doughs. You mix flour and water, add a little yeast, and away you go. And it's really at the heart of what makes working with natural leavening so complex and interesting. While time and temperature are the main factors, there are a ton of other factors, so it takes years for bakers to master the balance required to produce great products reliably.
